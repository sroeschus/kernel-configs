# kernel-patches
Repository of Linux kernel configurations. There are two different types of kernel configurations:
- kernel configs for QEMU
- kernel configs with production settings enabling more features

Each of them contains several versions of the kernel configs. Lower numbers are for
earlier versions of the kernel.
